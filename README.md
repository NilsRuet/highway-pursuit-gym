# Highway Pursuit Gym Environment

This repository provides a Python RL Gymnasium environment for the game *Highway Pursuit* by Adam Dawes, currently supporting version **1.2.3**.

**Note:** The game is available on [Adam Dawesâ€™ website](https://adamdawes.com/games/highway-pursuit.html), but the latest release (1.2.4) is not compatible with this environment.

The project consists of two main components:

- **Python package:** Implements the Gym environment and handles sending commands/actions to the game.
- **Mod/DLL:** Injected into the game to enable server functionality for communication.

Both components are required and should be installed together. Installation instructions are provided in the README files located in each subfolder.
